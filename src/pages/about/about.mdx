# Hi, I'm Collin

I am a recent graduate with a degree in computer science from the University of Washington. After graduating, I decided to shake up my life a little and moved to Boston, which I've absolutely loved so far. I have a passion for software development and a love for baseball. When I'm not coding, you can find me keeping up to date with the latest baseball news, including top prospect lists and advanced analytics. I'm also pretty proud of my fantasy football track record all thanks to the tableau dashboards I make every year before the draft.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me keeping up to date with baseball news and following top prospect lists, or enjoying the theater. I took theater classes in college and have a passion for the arts.

- Experience with modern web technologies: I have hands-on experience with popular front-end and back-end technologies, such as React, Node.js, and GraphQL.

- Proficiency in one or more programming languages, such as <a href="../projects?selected=0" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Java</a>, Python, or JavaScript: I have a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, and I am confident in my ability to pick up new languages quickly.
