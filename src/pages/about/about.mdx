# Hi, I'm Collin

I am a recent graduate with a degree in computer science from the University of Washington. After graduating, I decided to move to Boston because I figured the best way to learn about the east coast was to transplant myself there entirely, which I've absolutely loved so far. I have a passion for software development which really started when I began highschool - I was a part of the robotics team which is what made me fall in love with coding as a hobby. I'm also a huge baseball fan, and when I'm not coding, you can find me keeping up to date with the latest baseball news, including top prospect lists and advanced analytics. I'm also pretty proud of my fantasy football track record all thanks to the <a href="../projects?selected=3" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Tableau</a> dashboards I make every year before the draft.

## Skills and Achievements

- Strong problem-solving skills: I have a knack for breaking down complex problems and finding creative and efficient solutions.

- Experience with modern web technologies: I have hands-on experience with popular front-end and back-end technologies, such as React, Node.js, and GraphQL.

- Proficiency in one or more programming languages, such as <a href="../projects?selected=0" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Java</a>, <a href="../projects?selected=2" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Python</a>, or <a href="../projects?selected=1" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>JavaScript</a>: I have a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, and I am confident in my ability to pick up new languages quickly.

- Understanding of software design patterns and principles: I have a deep understanding of software design patterns and principles, and I apply this knowledge to build scalable and maintainable software systems.

- Excellent communication and collaboration skills: I enjoy working with others and have a proven track record of effectively communicating and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
