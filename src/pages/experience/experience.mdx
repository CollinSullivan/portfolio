## Introduction

I worked as a Developer in the E-commerce department at Costco Wholesale during my summer of 2022. With a background in software engineering and computer science, I was excited to apply my skills in a real-world setting and contribute to the company's success.

## Achievements

During my time at Costco, I primarily used <a href="../projects?selected=2" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Python</a>, OracleDB, <a href="../projects?selected=3" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Tableau</a>, and Alteryx to develop tools for different departments within the company. Rather than just listing my responsibilities, I want to highlight some of my achievements:

- Major Project 1: Designed and developed a cutting-edge freight cost calculator that utilized up to 6 months of historical data for individual items, resulting in exponentially more accurate cost predictions compared to conventional models that only considered package weight and size. Spearheaded the implementation of the calculator across multiple departments within the company, significantly improving freight margin accuracy by an estimated $7.2 million for the fiscal year.
- Major Project 2: Implemented Apriori data mining algorithm in <a href="../projects?selected=2" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Python</a> to perform market basket analysis on 2+ years of transactional data from Oracle SQL database. Created interactive <a href="../projects?selected=3" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Tableau</a> report using this data for departments and digital marketing team at Costco E-commerce, enabling them to identify optimal item bundles.
- Created and updated reports detailing inventory and freight information for sales analytics and financial data
- Increase efficiency of prior reports for the E-commerce chargeback team 
- Developed <a href="../projects?selected=3" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Tableau</a> dashboards for shipping discrepancy research

Through these projects, I was able to make a tangible impact on the company and contribute to its success.

## Problem-Solving Skills

As a software engineer, problem-solving is a crucial skill. During my time at Costco, I faced many technical challenges, but through collaboration with other team members, I was able to develop innovative solutions. Throughout many class projects I got a good look into what it takes to work well in a development team, but this was the first instance where I got to work directly with people who worked with this tech stack for many years and who have been professionals for even longer. Seeing how they problem solve and learning from them in brain storming sessions was extremely valuable.

## Learning and Growth

Through my experience at Costco, I realized I especially thrive in an environment where I have the room to be creative and explore possibilities. Something I didn't see coming was just how important it is to keep the user/consumer in mind throughout the product design process. Some of my smaller projects, like a file transfer pipeline for the business analysts I created, saved ~5 minutes of manually dragging and dropping files per day, but when I left it was something they didn't use because it was an unneccessary optimization. If I had kept them in the loop, it would have saved me precious development time I could have spent elsewhere.
I did reach a goal I set for myself to deal with big data in a way I never had the opportunity to throughout undergrad. Having the opportunity to work with millions of rows of data and create tools efficiently analize it was eye opening - for what felt like the first time I truely saw the importance of Big O runtime. 
I also got to build on my understanding of <a href="../projects?selected=2" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>Python</a> as well as having my first massive scale interaction with relational databases and SQL. 

## Conclusion

Overall, my internship at Costco was a valuable experience that helped me determine the type of company I want to work for and provided me with direct, specific, and actionable feedback on my projects and progress. I hope to take what I've learned and work for a company that values innovation and encourages creative problem-solving in my next professional role.
