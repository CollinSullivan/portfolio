## Overview

As a passionate software developer, I have always been fascinated by the game of chess and the intricacies involved in programming a successful chess bot. That's why when my Data Structures and Parallelism course proposed the challenging project in college to build a chess bot that utilized advanced parallel programming techniques, custom data structures, and heuristic algorithms to optimize its gameplay I was very excited.

## Approach

My approach to building the chess bot involved implementing parallel programming techniques such as parallel AlphaBeta pruning and the minimax algorithm to enable the bot to analyze multiple possible moves simultaneously. I also incorporated different chess bot heuristics, such as "Killer move heuristic" and "History Heuristic", to make the bot more successful in predicting and reacting to opponent moves.

To optimize the bot's performance, I implemented custom data structures such as MinHeap and priorityQueue, which allowed for faster move analysis and better memory management. All of the programming for this project was done in Java, and I made sure to adhere to best practices and maintain clean code throughout the development process.

## Reflection

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in advanced programming techniques and algorithms, as well as custom data structure implementation. I also developed important skills in software design and best practices. Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my problem-solving skills and creativity, and I am excited to bring this experience to a team of software developers in a professional setting.
