## Overview

One of the final courses I took in my degree program was Computational Fabrication.  I can confidently say that this course introduced me to the exciting field of computational design and fabrication. It provided me with a deep understanding of the essential computational tools used in every stage of the computational fabrication process, from hardware and its abstraction to high-level design specifications and interactions between designers and engineers.
ÃŸ
Throughout the course, we covered a wide range of topics, including hardware abstraction languages, geometry processing, physics-based simulation, optimization techniques, data-driven design methods, and algorithms for high-performance interactive applications. These tools are crucial for the next generation of manufacturing workflows and systems, and being able to use them effectively is becoming increasingly important in the industry.

## Approach

Throughout the course we had 3 Major assignments covering 3 major aspects of the Computational Fabrication process - as well as 3 labs where we actually got to use the physical hardware we were learning about/writing software for.

Assignments:
- Design
    - Implemented Voxelization algorithm for a 3D Mesh via ray tracing
- From Design to Machine Instructions
    - Implemented a slicer to generate G-Code from an STL (mesh) file. This slicer also incorporated an offsetting and toolpathing algorithm.
    - Implemented what is essentially a compiler for a Knitting Machine. Input an image and the output would be the knitting instruction code that could be passed directly to a Knitting machine, like the one we had in the Lab.
- Inverse Methods
    - Developed an O(nlogn) algorithm for finding the Pareto front of given 2D points. 
    - Implemented a topology optimization algorithm for structures (bridges in this case) that given a set of constraints and load forces would create a visualization via voxelization of the optimal bridge design. 
Labs:
- Laser Cutting
- 3D Printing
- Topology Optimization

## Reflection

Overall, taking Computational Fabrication was a valuable experience that gave me a comprehensive understanding of the computational fabrication pipeline. It has also sparked my interest in pursuing further studies in this field, as I see it as a key area for innovation and growth in the manufacturing industry.
