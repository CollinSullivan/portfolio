## Overview

As a data enthusiast and aspiring software developer, I recently undertook a challenging project to build a Tableau dashboard using Bay Area Craigslist rental data from 2000-2018, sourced from Kaggle. The goal of the project was to create a customizable tool that could be used to better understand rental trends in the Bay Area.

## Approach

To develop the Tableau dashboard, I first had to clean and manipulate the data using the Python Pandas library. This involved dealing with data quality issues such as null values, data type mismatches, and outliers.

Once the data was ready, I used Tableau to create an interactive and customizable dashboard that displays a range of key metrics and visualizations, such as average rent by year, average rent by neighborhood, and rental trends by property type. I am currently working on expanding this tool to cover a wider geographical area and include additional data sources to create a nationwide rental trends dashboard.

## Reflection

This project provided me with an opportunity to explore my passion for data visualization and gain hands-on experience with Tableau and data manipulation using Python. I was able to showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills by designing and developing a customized dashboard that provides valuable insights into Bay Area rental trends. I am excited to continue to expand this tool and to apply these skills to future data-driven projects.
