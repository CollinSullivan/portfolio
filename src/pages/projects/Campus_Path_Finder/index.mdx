## Overview

As a software developer with a passion for creating practical tools, I undertook a challenging project to build a custom pathfinding tool for the University of Washington campus. This tool utilized a Java Spark backend server and custom React components to provide an efficient way to navigate between different campus locations.

## Approach

The pathfinding algorithm was custom built for the University of Washington campus and was designed to be compatible with the Java Spark backend server. This server was used to store and access the data needed for pathfinding, and was integrated with the custom React components that I built.

Using the Gradle build tool throughout the development process, I was able to ensure that the project remained organized and up-to-date. I also built custom React components that were able to query the Spark backend server in real-time in order to provide visual representations of the most efficient paths between campus locations.

## Reflection

Through this project, I was able to showcase my ability to work with complex back-end technologies such as Java Spark, as well as my front-end development skills in creating custom React components. I was also able to gain valuable experience in algorithm design and implementation. Overall, this project allowed me to demonstrate my creativity and problem-solving skills, and I am excited to bring this experience to a team of software developers in a professional setting.
