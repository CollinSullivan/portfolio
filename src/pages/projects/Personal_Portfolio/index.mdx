# Overview

I am excited to present my portfolio website, which I built using Gatsbyjs. The website showcases my skills and projects, and demonstrates my proficiency in <a href="../projects?selected=1" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>JavaScript</a> and web development.

As a recent graduate with limited experience in these areas, I wanted to challenge myself to learn new skills and create something that would demonstrate my abilities to potential employers. I chose Gatsbyjs because of its flexibility and ease of use, and I found that it was an excellent tool for building a dynamic and responsive website.

# Approach

To build my portfolio website, I started by researching other portfolio websites and gathering ideas for layout and content.

Next, I installed Gatsbyjs and started building out the site's pages and components. I used a variety of tools and technologies, including React, GraphQL, and Markdown, to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

Throughout the development process, I focused on creating clean and organized code that would be easy to maintain and update. I also paid close attention to accessibility and mobile responsiveness, ensuring that the site would be usable by all users, regardless of their device or abilities.

I had realized that most people who might want to check out the projects I've done during my time at the University of Washington would run into the issue of not being able to see into the cs.washington domain, and thus I used the Gitlab REST API to import all of my projects so you can see them here! Of course I've added descriptions and extra sorting to make things smoother. 

One of the additional challenges I took on was to get my own domain name and set up its SSL certificate. This required me to learn about domain registration, DNS configuration, and SSL certificates. I found the process to be very interesting and rewarding, and it was a great opportunity to learn more about web infrastructure and security.

# Reflection

Building my portfolio website was an incredibly rewarding experience, both in terms of the skills I learned and the end result. I was able to gain valuable experience in web development and <a href="../projects?selected=1" target="_blank"  style={{color: "#DCDCDC"}}>JavaScript</a>, and I am proud of the finished product.

In retrospect, there are a few things I would have done differently. For example, I would have spent more time planning and organizing my code before starting development. I also would have liked to include more interactive elements on the site, such as animations and interactive components.

Overall, however, I am extremely satisfied with the site and what I was able to accomplish. Having never ventured into the world of front-end web development, I believe that this not only showcases my skills and projects but it also showcases just how fast I can learn new technologies and apply them.

All that being said, this will be a project that I am excited to keep coming back to!
