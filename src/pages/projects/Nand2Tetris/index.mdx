## Overview 

I created a general-purpose computer system with a modern software hierarchy via a course that followed the program on Nand2Tetrisk.org. I broke the overall project into 7 sub-projects:
- Boolean Logic
- Boolean Arithmetic
- Memory
- Machine Language & Automation
- "Building a Computer"
- Compiler and Debugging
- Reflection


##  Approach

I did this project as part of a class where learning important generalized computer science and software engineering knowledge was the goal. This meant there was a large focus on Version control (Git in this case) and quality documentation. 
The approach consisted of the following steps:

- Building basic logic gates using the Nand gate
- Using logic gates to build more complex components, such as adders, registers, and memory units
- Combining components to build a CPU and designing an instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Implementing a virtual machine (VM) that can run software written in a high-level language
- Developing a compiler that can translate high-level code into VM code
- Building an operating system (OS) that can interact with hardware and manage software resources
- Creating applications that can run on the computer system

Throughout the project, I used hardware description language (HDL) and software tools provided by the project to design and simulate digital circuits, write assembly code and high-level code, and test and debug my implementations.

## Reflection

The Nand2Tetris project was an incredibly rewarding and challenging experience that allowed me to gain a deep understanding of computer architecture and digital logic design. Through the project, I learned how a computer system works from the ground up and gained valuable skills in hardware design, software development, and project management.

Completing the project required a significant time commitment and a lot of hard work, but it was worth it in the end. I am proud of what I accomplished and feel more confident in my ability to tackle complex technical projects.
